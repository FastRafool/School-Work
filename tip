How to lose body fat and gain muscle:

1. TRACK YOUR CALORIES.
2. Maintain a slight calorie deficit of 300-500 cals UNDER maintenance PER DAY (if that number is 2000, aim for 1500-1700 per day).
3. Eat ALOT of protein. There's many equations for this, but let's keep it SIMPLE. 1g per lb of body weight is more than enough and easy to follow.
4. Go to the gym 4-5 times a week if you havenâ€™t been going, and if you have been going, continue to lift HEAVY. Nothing changes. Stay in the 6-20 rep range.
5. SLEEP 8-10 hours a night. This is CRITICAL.
6. Drink water to the point your urine is clear all day.
7. Abstain from alcohol/drugs.
8. Eat 80% MINIMUM of your calories from nutrient dense food with only 1 ingredient (lean meat, vegetables, fruits). The other 20% is for variance of foods you like but it MUST BE TRACKED!

I hope you enjoy this meal plan program!
