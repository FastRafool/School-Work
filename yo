Subject: Request for Amazon SES Production Access for Arxival Newsletter Service

Body:

Hello AWS Support Team,

I am writing to request production access for Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for our application, Arxival Newsletter Service. We are currently in the development phase and need to move out of the SES sandbox environment to meet our operational requirements and launch timelines.

About Our Application:

Application Name: Arxival Newsletter Service
Purpose: Our application is designed to send daily, weekly, and monthly newsletters containing updates on new scientific research publications and news related to AWS Braket, Azure Quantum, and Oxford Quantum Circuits to subscribed users.
Email Sending Use Case:

Nature of Emails: Transactional and Informational
Estimated Volume: We plan to send approximately 10,000 emails per month during the initial phase.
Recipients: Our recipients are professionals and enthusiasts in the quantum computing field who have opted into receiving updates from our platform.
Compliance and Best Practices:

Opt-In Process: We use a double opt-in process to ensure that the recipients have explicitly consented to receive emails from us.
Handling Bounces and Complaints: We have implemented mechanisms to handle bounces and complaints effectively, ensuring immediate removal of non-deliverable email addresses and adhering to recipient feedback.
Unsubscribe Mechanism: All our emails include a straightforward and visible way to unsubscribe, ensuring compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act and respecting user preferences.
Technical Setup:

DKIM: We have configured DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) for our sending domains to authenticate our email sources and improve our sender reputation.
SPF and DMARC Records: We have set up SPF and DMARC records to validate our emails and enhance deliverability, preventing our emails from being marked as spam.
Reason for Production Access:
As we approach our public launch, it is critical for us to ensure that our email systems are fully operational and scalable. Transitioning out of the sandbox environment will help us:

Test email functionalities comprehensively in real-world scenarios.
Start engaging with our early users who are essential to our beta testing phase.
Implement real-time email-based features without the limitations of the sandbox environment.
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of email practices and are keen to move forward in compliance with AWS’s guidelines. Thank you for considering our request. We are happy to provide any additional information needed to expedite this process.
